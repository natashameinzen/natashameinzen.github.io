Schedule Page
Included thumbnail images with popups, hyperlinks, slideshow
pulls from database
google translate
distance with map


Form Input Page
Allows entry addition into schedule database
basic validation (alphnumeric, date/time ranges)
page navigation, successful submission

Widgets Page
twitter stream, instagram widget, password strength validator (used jquery and javascript)

All styled with css (both inline, embedded, and external)

Back-End
HTTP requests - GET and POST
establish socket and binds to a port
send request to server, server handles request and returns appropriate response
implemented a server different ways - HTTP protocol and Express (Node.js), 

Used SQL/MySQL to create, push, and pull from databased
Created Admin page to allow login and sessions


The purpose of the UStudy application was to create an application that was not yet in existence that would help students at the University of Minnesota using User Interface and Design practices. To begin the process, my teammembers and I brainstormed various app ideas. After much deliberation, we settled upon an app that helped students find and form study groups. Once the idea was formed, we each performed a series of interviews on a diverse set of students to better understand what they felt would be beneficial to see in an app. We analyzed the transcripts from all of the interviews and found 5 main implications that our application must meet.

Once our implications were set, we began the ideation process. During this time, we proposed over 100 different ideas that our app should contain that met those 5 implications. We then grouped those ideas into categories, including, but not limited to, Features, Study Times/Locations, Security, and Group Dynamics. In pursuit of these qualities, we determined UStudy will offer UMN students the ability to form study groups in-app, and to communicate with all the standard features of a messaging service. Students and study groups will be able to use the app to find nearby study locations; they may then schedule events and meetings at these locations at times that work for them. UStudy users will be able to control which aspects of their personal information they share with others through the app, to ensure that their privacy and comfort are maintained.

The next step of our process was to actually create the application. We first created a POP, which allows hand-drawn sketches to be turned into interactive protoypes. This allowed us to have a better grasp on how the entire application would come together and made us aware of what pieces we were missing. Once our POP was complete and we included everything that met the features and implications above, we began coding the application using Android Studio. Using the POP, we delegated certain features and pages to each teammember to complete within a designated timeline. 

Finally, in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of our completed application, we had another diverse set of University of Minnestoa students use our apps and collected feedback. We asked them to perform both "think aloud" walk throughs as well as summative tasks to obtain time-to-complete-a-task data, misstep data, and overall feedback. From those analytics, we were able to determine futuristic modifications to the User Interface Design to better the application.
