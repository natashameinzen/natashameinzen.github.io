This research project was constructed to determine the most environmentally friendly drying technique used in paper product production, specifically in the pulp stage. I, along with a few other research assistants, were tasked with executing the same experiment, but with different variables, such as types of dryers and pulp concentration. Once we had completed the experiments, all the data was compiled to present to the head of the project.

As a research assistant for this project, I was responsible for taking measurements, processing calculations, and hypothesizing possible solutions for issues that occured. I started by making each individual test sample. From there, I took precise measurements on the samples, such as width, strength, and porousness and permeability using a various number of devices and computer programs. Once I collected all the data, I ran calculations and reported to the head of the research assistants. This data was then compared to the data collected for the same experiment using different variables to determine which process was the most bio-friendly.

This research project created a setting for both individual work and teamwork. A significant part of the project was done individually, but without working as a team, the project would have created incomplete data. We helped one another decipher the data produced and discussed new ways that could improve each process. Because of the amount of teamwork, we were able to present verifiable information and confidently suggest the best solution to improving paper production.
