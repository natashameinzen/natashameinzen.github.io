summary: A database created to organize celestial bodies.
---

This program was created to organize a wide range of items and increase the efficiency of sorting through each item's data. The topic chosen for this specific program was celestial bodies, with each body containing its individual qualifications. It accepts data entries, sorts entries, and allows users to search through the entries by various means, such as by type of body or qualifications of the bodies.

This project was constructed for a CSCI 1933 data structures and algorithms class. It is similar to the foundations of many complex databases and gave me pertinent insight to the various methods of storing and retreiving data (ex. linked lists, arrays, sorting algorithms, etc).
