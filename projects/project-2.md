Battleboards is a game that is similar to Battleship, except that it can be played by one person and it has a few special "powers", such as using a drone to get a small glimpse of your opponents board and enabling you to visualize your board. I developed this project in CSCI 1933, Spring 2017. 

I started this project by dividing it into smaller subsections, such as programming the boats, the board, and the moves. Once each individual section was complete, I compiled them together to create the entire game. The code is written in Java and users can play using the command line. This project strengthed my skills in project management, design, and implementation. 

Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.
