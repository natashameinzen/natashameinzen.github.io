A possible final project idea would be to create an application that allows students to connect through recreational activities. This idea is similar to the Club Hub application example. The target audience of this application would be University of Hawaii students who want to branch out and meet new people interested in the same recreational activities without having to be committed to a specific club. 

This application would require UH students to log in with the ID. Once logged in, there would be multiple pages the student could visit. For example, the student could view a list of all current recreational student organizations, who could post news and events that students can participate in. Another page would enable students to post about an excusion, whether it be somewhere on Oahu or to another island. If any other students are interested in said excusrion, they can click a link or comment on the post, which would connect them to a private group chat to discuss details of the trip. Furthermore, there can be another page that contains reviews on various recreational activities, in which students can describe any experiences they may have had, or any advice they have about a certain activties.
