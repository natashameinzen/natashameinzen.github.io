summary: Web application that allows University of Hawaii students to connect with other students through outdoor adventures.
---

<a href="https://islandwanderer.github.io/">Island Wanderer</a> is the perfect website for University of Hawaii students who want to explore the islands of Hawaii with other students. The Hawaiian Islands have a lot to offer, from hiking to snorkeling to luaus to relaxing at the beach. However, sometimes it can be hard to organize a group of people to go explore these places. Island Wanderer is here to solve this problem. Students can form groups to go on adventures together, creating countless unforgettable memories while meeting new people along the way.

The application was designed by myself and two other University of Hawaii students. Each page within the project was split amongst the three of us. We began building the application by constructing a time line. The first step was to create mockups of all the pages necessary. Once this step was complete, we were able to better assess and tweaks that needed to be made and how all the pages would fit together. The next step in the process was to actually make the tweaks and combine the pages. Throughout this process we maintained communication with one another to ensure there were no issues with commits to GitHub. To see the code for this application, visit <a href="https://github.com/islandwanderer">Island Wanderer's GitHub</a> page.

The Island Wanderer app created a setting for both individual work and teamwork. A significant part of the project was done individually, but without working as a team, the application would have never run correctly. Furthermore, this application taught me a lot about group coding projects, including working with a group through the means of GitHub. Aside from introducing me to a new type of teamwork, Island Wanderer also taught me many lessons in the technical field, such as integrating different languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript) into one application. Additionally, I gained valuable experience with design patterns and how to correctly utilize them while still adhering to the code of ethics.
