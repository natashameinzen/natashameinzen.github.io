summary: Web application that allows University of Hawaii students to connect with other students through outdoor adventures.
---

Island Wanderer is the perfect website for University of Hawaii students who want to explore the islands of Hawaii with other students. The Hawaiian Islands have a lot to offer, from hiking to snorkeling to luaus to relaxing at the beach. However, sometimes it can be hard to organize a group of people to go explore these places. Island Wanderer is here to solve this problem. Students can form groups to go on adventures together, creating countless unforgettable memories while meeting new people along the way.



As a research assistant for this project, I was responsible for taking measurements, processing calculations, and hypothesizing possible solutions for issues that occured. I started by making each individual test sample. From there, I took precise measurements on the samples, such as width, strength, and porousness and permeability using a various number of devices and computer programs. Once I collected all the data, I ran calculations and reported to the head of the research assistants. This data was then compared to the data collected for the same experiment using different variables to determine which process was the most bio-friendly.

This research project created a setting for both individual work and teamwork. A significant part of the project was done individually, but without working as a team, the project would have created incomplete data. We helped one another decipher the data produced and discussed new ways that could improve each process. Because of the amount of teamwork, we were able to present verifiable information and confidently suggest the best solution to improving paper production.
